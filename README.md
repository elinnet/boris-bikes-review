Boris Bikes challenge on Week 1 of Makers Academy. 

A simple program to manage bikes that can be rented by users from docking stations and returned at the end of the rental. The bikes can break whilst being used, after which they will not be available for rental after they are returned and repaired.

A van is used to move broken bikes from the stations to the garage, where these broken bikes will be fixed.  Once fixed, the bikes can be returned to docking stataions.  The vans, docking stations and garages have fixed capacity, so they cannot take more bikes than they can hold.
